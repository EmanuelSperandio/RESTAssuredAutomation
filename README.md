# Rest-Assured API Automation

A simple example of automation test using rest-assured to check our API. I created this to help with my video classes that I will eventually upload on my YouTube channel.

Tests:
- Health Check  
- Functional Test   
- Contract Test    [IN PROGRESS]

Libraries used 
---------------------
- TestNG
- Java Faker (to make fake users)
- Allure (to help with the reports)
- JSON Schema Validator (for contract tests)
- Lombok (great annotations that "adds" code to your class in compile time)
